# A2: Stopwatch and Timer

Build a stopwatch and timer that mimics how the Android's stopwatch and timer functionality works.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will:

* Implement a simple stopwatch and timer conforming to a design.
* Practice developing UI elements (such as `TextBox` and `TabControl`) and event handling. 
* Practice using the `Timers` class and some basic probelm solving. 
* Practice development and debugging in the Visual Studio IDE.
* Practice development with C# and WPF.

## Deliverable / Submission

You will deliver a .zip file containing your source code into the Dropbox in D2L.

1. From the project directory, remove the `bin\` and `obj\` folders
2. Zip up the solution directory, ensuring that all your source files are included
3. Upload the zip file into the Dropbox in D2L by the deadline

We will extract your code and run it, looking to see if the desgin matches the specifications below.

## Steps

1. Read through the documentation below and watch the solution video.
2. Create a new C#/WPF application following the description. 
3. Zip it up, and submit via D2L.

## Description

Your job is to implement the design given in the solution video below, following the specifcations listed in the next section. 

([Here's a video of the solution](https://youtu.be/yk8tQS2PZa0))

## Specifications

To match this solution you must have:

1. A tab controller with a tab for the Stopwatch view and a tab for the Timer view. 
2. The Stopwatch view contains: 
	a. A Label with the time counting up (just minutes and seconds are okay). 
	b. A start/stop Button to start the stopwatch counter and stop it. 
	c. A record Button that is enabled when the stop watch is running. This will record the current time as an item in a Listbox.
	d. When the stopwatch has been stopped, the record button then turns into a Reset Button that erases the recorded time list and resets the stopwatch to 00:00
3. The Timer view contains: 
	a. A Label with the time counting down. 
	b. Three Textboxes (with appropriate labels) for Hour, Minute and Seconds to set the Timer. 
	c. A Start button to start the Timer's count down. When the start button is pressed the values from the Textboxes are applied to the timer and begins the timer's count down. 
	d. When the timer is within 3 seconds, the font colour changes to red and back to black when it is complete. 

## Tutorial Video

([Tutorial 2 video](https://youtu.be/O2o0CBx2hto))

This tutorial video covers how to create a small game in WPF, and covers hoe to use the Timers class and recaps event handling for UI elements.

## Hints

1. Take notes based on the requirements and specification above. Make your own shorthand that is easier to interpret for you (rather than having to read the whole text). A good idea for this class is to make a sketch of where the project is going. 
2. Look through C# and WPF documentation for a better understanding on how to create UI applications in Visual Studio. Here are some tutorials you can browse through:
	- https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/140611/WPF-Tutorial-Beginning
	- http://www.wpf-tutorial.com
	- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/wpf/wpf_hello_world.htm
3. Work on the "normal" cases first before worrying about making your UI look the exact same. (Though, ultimately, make sure you adhere to the specification above!)
4. You will likely need to capture `KeyUp` events from the `TextBox` controls.
5. You will need to use the `TabControl` control (which puts in a tabbed pane, and two `TabItem` tabs inside). Inside each of the `TabItems`, you can replace the `Grid` with a `Canvas`, and continue onward.
6. There are at least [five different timers in .NET](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10317088/why-there-are-5-versions-of-timer-classes-in-net). Each has slightly different behaviour and semantics. The tuorial video shows the use of the `Sytsem.Timers.Timer`, which requires the use of an `Invoke` method to interact with the UI thread. An alternative is to use the `System.Windows.Threading.DispatchTimer`, which operates on the thread that it was called on. Using the `DispatchTimer` means you don't need to use the `Invoke` functionality.

## Grading Rubric

You work will be graded on a 0, check-, check and check+ grade. 

A check grade is awarded when all the specifications above have been met. 

A check- grades is received when some requirements from the specifications are missing or implemented incorrectly. 

A check+ grade can be recieved if you meet all the specifications and to the design or functionality (e.g. alarm clock functionality, or a really nice UI design, or alternately a "calculator-button" number entry mechanism) and implement it correctly. 

## No Late Assignments

Your assignment is due at noon on the specified due date. No late assignments will be accepted.
