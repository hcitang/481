# Assignments

There are three assignments, worth a total of 10 points, plus a bonus assignment assessed near the end of the term.

Assignments are to be completed individually. You may speak to your classmates about the ideas, but are not allowed to use one another's writing. These are all (essentially) written assignments. 

Note: if you talk with a classmate about the assignments, you should list them in an *Acknowledgements* section of your submission.

| Assignment | Value | Due Date |
| ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| A0 - Slack Introduction | | 9/14, before class |
| A1 - Thinking About Design | 4% | 9/26 |
| A2 - User-Centered Research | 4% | 10/12 |
| Teammate Feedback | 2% | One day after each project component is submitted | 

## A0: Slack Introduction

In this assignment, your task is to join the CPSC481 Slack chat [http://cpsc481-ucalgary.slack.com](http://cpsc481.slack.com), and introduce yourself.

* Create a Slack account
* Join http://cpsc481-ucalgary.slack.com
* Put a picture of yourself in your account
* Post a message in the #profiles channel with your name, why you are taking this course, something that interests you, and your desired super power (or a super power you have).

## A1: Thinking About Design [(detail)](a1.md)

You are to reflect on your experiences with designed technology and tools in your everyday life.

## A2: User-Centered Research [(detail)](a2.md)

You are to consider the IDEO methods for several different design problems, identifying which would be good methods for understanding the design problem, and arguing for why.

## Bonus: Weekly Submissions to #baddesign or #greatdesign

Learning how to design effectively is really about *thinking* about design regularly. For bonus marks (up to 2%, at discretion of course instructor), post regularly to the Slack channels #baddesign and #gooddesign (e.g. once a week for each week in the term). An effective post includes:

* a photo of an object/interface that is an example of good (or bad) design,
* an explanation for why it is good (or bad), 
* and if it is a bad design, a design alternative that solves the problem.
