# Assignments

There are four assignments, worth a total of 12 points, plus a bonus assignment assessed near the end of the term. The purpose of these assignments is to get you to think about design, and to help familiarize you with UI programming basics.

Assignments are to be completed individually. You may speak to your classmates about the ideas, but are not allowed to use one another's writing or to share code. The programming components will be completed using C# and WPF.

Note: if you talk with a classmate about the assignments, you should list them in an *Acknowledgements* section of your submission.

| Assignment | Value | Due Date |
| ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| A0 - Slack Introduction | | 5/17, before class |
| A1 - Hello World WPF | 3% | Mon 5/22, noon |
| A2 - Stopwatch and Timer | 3% | Mon 5/29, noon |
| A3 - Image Viewer | 3% | Fri 6/9, noon |
| A4 - User-Centered Research | 3% | Fri 6/16, noon |

## A0: Slack Introduction

In this assignment, your task is to join the CPSC481 Slack chat [http://cpsc481-2017spring.slack.com](http://cpsc481-2017spring.slack.com), and introduce yourself.

* Create a Slack account
* Join http://cpsc481-2017spring.slack.com
* Put a picture of yourself in your account
* Post a message in the #profiles channel with your name, why you are taking this course, something that interests you, and your desired super power (or a super power you have).

## A1: Hello World WPF

The purpose of this assignment is for you to familiarize yourself with WPF controls, and how to use UI event handling.

## A2: Stopwatch and Timer

You will mimic the stopwatch/timer functionality of the Android Clock app. You will learn how to use the Timer component, and how to "multiplex" event handling.

## A3: Image Viewer

You will build an image browser that handles drag and drop from the filesystem, and uses animation for transitions.

## A4: User-Centered Research

You are to consider the IDEO methods for several different design problems, identifying which would be good methods for understanding the design problem, and arguing for why.

## Bonus: Weekly Submissions to #designexamples

Learning how to design effectively is really about *thinking* about design regularly. For bonus marks (up to 2%, at discretion of course instructor), post regularly to the Slack channels #baddesign and #gooddesign (e.g. twice a week for each week in the term). An effective post includes:

* a photo of an object/interface that is an example of good (or bad) design,
* an explanation for why it is good (or bad), 
* and if it is a bad design, a design alternative that solves the problem.
