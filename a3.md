# A3: Image Browser

Build an image browser that allows a user to drag-and-drop images into the browser. Pressing a "Sort" button arranges the images into a grid.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will:

* Know how to make a control into a "Drop target" for Drag and Drop functionality.
* Know how to use a simple mouse interaction model to implement movement on a `Canvas`.
* Know how to use `DoubleAnimation` to animate a dependency property on a control in WPF.
* Practice development and debugging in the Visual Studio IDE.
* Practice development with C# and WPF.

## Deliverable / Submission

You will deliver a .zip file containing your source code into the Dropbox in D2L.

1. From the project directory, remove the `bin\` and `obj\` folders
2. Zip up the solution directory, ensuring that all your source files are included
3. Upload the zip file into the Dropbox in D2L by the deadline

We will extract your code and run it, looking to see if the desgin matches the specifications below.

## Description

Your job is to implement the design given in the solution video below, following the specifcations listed in the next section. 

([Here's a video of the solution](http://hcitang.org/uploads/Teaching/481-A3-solution.webm))

## Specifications

To match this solution you must have:

1. A UI where a user can drag and drop images (e.g. `.PNG`, `.JPG` or `.JPEG` files) from Windows Explorer onto the pane.
2. When the images are dropped onto the pane, they should create a new `Image` control with the image inside. To make things simple when laying things out as a grid, make all the images 100x100 when they are loaded in.
3. Images should be "draggable" -- when I click down on an image and then drag, it should move accordingly.
4. There ought to be a "Sort" button in the top left. When I press it, images should end up arranged nicely in a grid fashion. They should all be visible.
5. Items should animate nicely into their final grid location.

## Hints

1. `Canvas` element by default doesn't have a "touchable" space. Set the `Background` to `Transparent` (or another colour) to make it work with drag and drop ([Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7762957/why-doesnt-wpf-canvas-alow-drop)). It also doesn't receive mouse vents until this is set.
2. You can add items to the `Canvas` by adding to its `Children` collection (e.g. `this.canvas.Children.Add(myImage);`).
3. WPF elements have a lot of properties that you can request by using `GetProperty` (and sometimes set using `SetProperty`). Some that you may find useful here include: `Canvas.LeftProperty`, `Canvas.TopProperty`, and `Panel.ZIndexProperty`. For example, you could request a button's X position by asking: `button.GetProperty(Canvas.LeftProperty)`. Similarly, you could set it by using `button.SetProperty(Canvas.TopProperty)`.
4. You will likely need to animate the X position of the images independently of the Y position. But, you can fire both animations off at the same time.
5. Weird GOTCHA: after runnning a `DoubleAnimation`, you cannot set the value of a dependency property from another part of the code ([see this Stackoverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/960322/in-wpf-after-doubleanimation-uielement-property-cannot-be-changed)). To get around this, take the following steps: (a) attach to the `Completed` event handler; (b) in that event handler, explicitly set the final value of the dependency property, and (c) restart a new animation with the animationtimeline set to null. For example, if you were setting the opacity of an image to 100% opaque at the end of the animation, you would use the following: `image.SetValue(UIElement.OpacityProperty, 1.0); image.BeginAnimation(UIElement.OpacityProperty, null);`
6. You will likely need to capture and process `MouseDown` and `MouseMove` events for each of the `Image` controls that you add on the `Canvas`. Make sure you're only moving `Image` items when they are dragged!

## Grading Rubric

You work will be graded on a 0, check-, check and check+ grade. 

A check grade is awarded when all the specifications above have been met. 

A check- grade is awarded when some requirements from the specifications are missing or implemented incorrectly. 

A check+ grade can be awarded if you meet all the specifications and to the design or functionality (e.g. do not stretch/squish images but still arrange nicely as grid; allow for images to be loaded to a specified size; implement slideshow functionality, etc.)

## No Late Assignments

Your assignment is due at noon on the specified due date. No late assignments will be accepted.
