# A1: Introduction to WPF

You are given a specification and a final design of some basic UI elements. Your job is to write the code to fulfill the specifications and produce something similar (or the same) as the given design. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will:

* Implement a small user interface conforming to a design.
* Practice developing basic UI elements and event handling. 
* Practice development and debugging in the Visual Studio IDE.
* Practice development with C# and WPF.

## Deliverable / Submission

You will deliver a .zip file containing your source code into the Dropbox in D2L.

1. From the project directory, remove the `bin\` and `obj\` folders
2. Zip up the solution directory, ensuring that all your source files are included
3. Upload the zip file into the Dropbox in D2L by the deadline

We will extract your code and run it looking to see if the design matches the specifications below.

## Steps

1. Read through the documentation below
2. Create a new C#/WPF application following the description. 
4. Zip it up, and submit via D2L.

## Description

Your job is to implement the design given in the solution video below, following the specifcations listed in the next section.

## Specifications

To match this solution you must have:

1. A label with the content "Hello World" in font "Harlow Solid Italic" (or something else fun!) and in a different colour (blue in the solution but any colour but black also works).
2. A slider control that changes the alpha value of the "Hello World" label (regardless of the colour) when the slider value is changed.
3. A button with a different boarder and text colour. (Green and red in the video). The button changes the colour of the "Hello World" label when it is clicked. And changes the colour back on the second click. The button also changes the colour of the button boarded and text colour when it is clicked, then changes back on the second click. 

## Tutorial Video

This tutorial video covers how to create a shell of a WPF project, and covers the basics on how to implement event handlers for various UI controls in WPF.

## Hints

1. Take notes based on the requirements and specification above. Make your own shorthand that is easier to interpret for you (rather than having to read the whole text). A good idea for this class is to make a sketch of where the project is going. 
2. Look through C# and WPF documentation for a better understanding on how to create UI applications in Visual Studio. Here are some tutorials you can browse through:
	- https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/140611/WPF-Tutorial-Beginning
	- http://www.wpf-tutorial.com
	- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/wpf/wpf_hello_world.htm
3. Work on the "normal" cases first before worrying about making your UI look the exact same. (Though, ultimately, make sure you adhere to the specification above!)

## Grading Rubric

You work will be graded on a 0, check-, check and check+ grade. 

A check grade is awarded when all the specifications above have been met. 

A check- grades is received when some requirements from the specifications are missing or implemented incorrectly. 

A check+ grade can be recieved if you meet all the specifications plus some "interesting" stretch goal. For instance, if you add a new UI control and meaningfully control the ouput, this would be considered a check+ grade (assuming the main requirements are fulfilled).

## No Late Assignments

Your assignment is due at noon on the specified due date. No late assignments will be accepted.
