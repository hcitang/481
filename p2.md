# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

Now that you understand your users and their problem, your job is to brainstorm designs for them. As I said in class, the best way to come up with a good idea is to have lots of them, and narrow down. In this component, you will brainstorm many designs, and then use some basic criteria to filter and select the best ideas. You will then polish these ideas, and create a storyboard for at least one to show the entire scope of the interaction. From here, you will construct a low-fi video prototype of how you expect your system to be used. Then, you will conduct a task-centered system walkthrough of the major tasks that you identified from P1.

The goal of this component is to show you that if you have an open mind, your first idea is (unlikely) to be your best idea. Instead, the process of brainstorming, discussing and affinity diagramming (particularly with a deep dive group) can help you find good ideas that you had not considered before.
Further, the video prototyping and task-centered system walkthrough will also generate new insight as to whether your (current) favourite design is even the best approach!

## Major Activities
* **Brainstorm session.** With your deep dive group, schedule a mutual time that you can get together and work for at least an hour together. Brainstorm and sketch ideas -- one each on a single sheet of paper. The goal here is to sketch as many distinct ideas as you can -- you should aim for at least -- *at least* -- four sketches a person (at least 12 sketches). Anything goes: crazy or boring, whole system or even just a small piece of the system. You are aiming here for *variance*: **the ideas should be different from one another**. You are allowed to build off of one another's ideas, but make sure that they're different. If you end up with a bunch of sketches that are essentially variations on the exact same idea, try again, because you didn't do it right.

Time permitting, I will make time available for you to do this session during tutorial time.

* **Affinity diagramming session**. This can be part of your brainstorming session, or a different one altogether. As a group, go through each of the sketches one by one, discussing the main idea of the sketch. Construct an affinity diagram with these sketches, or with ideas extracted from the sketches. At the end of this, you will have several different groups (say 3-5 groups). Discuss each of these groups in relation to the design requirements you identified in P1, their weaknesses, strengths, feasibility and originality.
* **Select and polish ideas**. From your affinity diagramming session, select the three most promising ideas. Add annotations and/or provide descriptions where appropriate for these three ideas.
* **Refine ideas and create storyboard**. Select one of the three promising ideas, and construct a storyboard that illustrates its context of use (in relation to a task), how it would be used. This should depict some of the interface, and how a user would interact with it to perform the tasks you identified in P1.
* **Video prototype**. Based on the storyboard, construct a video prototype (no more than 2-3 minutes) that illustrates how your system would be used. Be sure to illustrate at least one complete task scenario. _This can be uploaded to YouTube or saved in a cloud storage service._
* **Task-centered system walkthrough.** Based on [the template](http://hcitang.org/uploads/Teaching/481-tcsd-walkthrough-template.docx), one of the tasks you identified from P1, conduct a task-centered system walkthrough based on your storyboard and video prototype. If you decide now that some of the tasks that you had put together in P1 need to be revised based on your research (i.e. it doesn't match an actual use case), then rearticulate the task in your P1 page (and indicate that this has been done here).

## Deliverable
* You deliver this project component via your GitHub repo as a working webpage.
* Provide your **video prototype**, along with a concise description of what the prototype is illustrating
* Provide the **storyboard** on which your video prototype was constructed
* Provide a summary of the major issues that your **task-centered walkthrough** identified (also include scans/images of the raw documents that you created during this process)
* Provide an image of the overall **sketching/brainstorming activity**, and two or three close-up images and details on what these sketches are illustrating.
* Develop a one or two paragraph **reflection** section that discusses this entire ideation process -- what went well for your group, what went poorly, what would you do differently if you were to do it again.
