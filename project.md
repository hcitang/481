# Team Project

The project is a hands-on opportunity to try the methods and ideas that we cover and discuss in class -- in particular, to engage in a user-centered design process. The two main lessons to be learned here is that: (a) designers do not rely on their intuition, but instead rely on real user research, and that (b) design is really about a process. This is a process that you can apply as a software developer in the real world.

You will choose a project idea to work from, and use that project idea for every component. The project has four main components. The first component asks you to consider real users in the context of real activities, and understand their real needs. The second component is about the process of brainstorming and iteratively developing and building on ideas quickly and cheaply, asking you to identify the most important aspects of your system. The third component is about actually building the system in code, and then evaluating the interface/system that you have built using heuristics. In the final component, you provide a brief report, and presentation about the entire scope of your project.

## Teams

The project is to be completed in **teams of three**, where all members are from the same tutorial section. The idea here is to work as a deep dive group to generate a wide breadth of alternate and varied design ideas -- just as you would in the real world.

Teams will create and operate under the particulars of their own team contract (P0). Consequences can be as severe as kicking a team member off the team.

## Portfolio

Your team needs a binder that is 1 1/2" thick. All of your project components will be handed in to the TAs in a binder. The idea is to compile all of your project materials in one place, making it easy for us (when we mark your materials) to see the evolution of your project and work.

You should have section separators for each of the components of the project, a cover sheet (with your names on outside cover), and name/contact information on the first page of the binder.

Print off the Grading Sheets, and put these at the front of the appropriate section.

## Project Ideas
You may choose from any of the following project ideas. Most will need some narrowing (i.e. focus) to make it tractable. My suggestion: pick a project that speaks to you (i.e. you find/found it an issue).

1. Curated maps and routes (e.g. Spotify for walking or biking)
2. Garden guide (e.g. planning, managing and tracking a garden)
3. Back-end system for an animal shelter (for employees to manage animals)
4. Back-end of restaurant menu ordering system (e.g. employee interface for adding inventory)
5. Catalog store shopping assistant
6. Recreation Centre app
7. Ski hill application
8. Mobile field guide for a park (e.g. for mushrooms, flowers, etc.)
9. Driving data app
10. Period tracking app
11. Farmer market vendor app

This year, we're going to be using Java Android Studio to build Android apps!

<!--
* Kid-friendly Web Browser: design a web browser for young children.
* Cooking Instructor: design a system that can be used to prepare and cook a recipe.
* Bus ticking kiosk: design a system for travellers in the terminal building.
* Course registration system: redesign PeopleSoft!
* Something of your choosing (note that this choice needs to be cleared by your TA by the time P0 is due)

## Project Components
| Component | Value | Due |
| --------- | ----- | --- |
| [P0: Team Contracts](p0.md) - Establishing a set of rules that outline how the team will work, expectations, and consequences for poor performance | 1% | 9/23, 9/30, week of 10/3 |
| [P1: User Research](p1.md) - Conduct three different IDEO methods to learn about your users in their environment. | 7% | 10/19 |
| [P2: Ideation and Lo-Fi Prototypes](p2.md) - Brainstorm and sketch a variety of possible interfaces for your system, identifying important aspects of a user's flow. Create a video prototype of your system, and conduct a task-centered walkthrough of major tasks. | 10% | 11/2 |
| [P3: Hi-Fi Prototypes and Heuristic Evaluation](p3.md) - Implement important features of your interface and system, and conduct a heuristic evaluation on its major features. | 12% | 11/28 (paper); week of 11/28 (demos) |
| [P4: Final Report and Presentation](p4.md) - Provide a report on your work, and present the work to your classmates. | 5% | 12/7 (paper); week of 12/5 (presentations) |
