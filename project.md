# Team Project

The project is a hands-on opportunity to try the methods and ideas that we cover and discuss in class -- in particular, to engage in a user-centered design process. The two main lessons to be learned here is that: (a) designers do not rely on their intuition, but instead rely on real user research, and that (b) design is really about a process. This is a process that you can apply as a software developer in the real world.

You will choose a project idea to work from, and use that project idea for every component. The project has four main components. The first component asks you to consider real users in the context of real activities, and understand their real needs. The second component is about the process of brainstorming and iteratively developing and building on ideas quickly and cheaply, asking you to identify the most important aspects of your system. The third component is about actually building the system in code, and then evaluating the interface/system that you have built using heuristics. In the final component, you provide a brief report, and presentation about the entire scope of your project.

## Teams

The project is to be completed in **teams of three**, where all members are from the same tutorial section. The idea here is to work as a deep dive group to generate a wide breadth of alternate and varied design ideas -- just as you would in the real world.

Teams will create and operate under the particulars of their own team contract (P0). Consequences can be as severe as kicking a team member off the team.

## GitHub Portfolio

Your team will submit projects via a GitHub Pages portfolio site. The idea is to use this as a portfolio site for your work, allowing you to see the evolution of your work, and for you to showcase your work to potential employers later.

## Project Ideas

You may choose from any of the following project ideas. Most will need some narrowing (i.e. focus) to make it tractable. My suggestion: pick a project that speaks to you (i.e. you find/found it an issue).

* Walking tour/route creation app (ex. creating and sharing tours)
* Garden guide (e.g. planning, managing and tracking a garden)
* Back-end system for an animal shelter (for employees to manage animals)
* Back-end of restaurant menu ordering system (e.g. employee interface for * adding inventory)
* Recreation Centre app
* Mobile field guide for a park (e.g. for mushrooms, flowers, etc.)
* Genealogy for Animal Breeders
* Menstruation tracking app
* Farmer market vendor app
* Dating app for a specific group (ex. elderly people, farmers)
* Web Browser for a specific group (ex. kids, disabilities)
* Cooking Instructor
* Family Communication System (for a specific task or activity) 
* Home Theater PC for a Specific Group (ex. kids, disabilities) 
* FabLab App (ex. Garage 142)
* New Mommy app (tracking baby progress, feeding tracker, sleep tracking, …)
* Theme park app for family + kid (“FastPass”)

This year, we're going to be using [Axure](https://www.axure.com/) to prototype apps!

## Project Components
| Component | Value | Due |
| --------- | ----- | --- |
| [P0: Team Contracts](p0.md) - Establishing a set of rules that outline how the team will work, expectations, and consequences for poor performance | 1% | 5/19 noon |
| [P1: User Research](p1.md) - Conduct three different IDEO methods to learn about your users in their environment. | 7% | 5/26 noon |
| [P2: Ideation and Lo-Fi Prototypes](p2.md) - Brainstorm and sketch a variety of possible interfaces for your system, identifying important aspects of a user's flow. Create a video prototype of your system, and conduct a task-centered walkthrough of major tasks. | 10% | 6/9 noon |
| [P3: Hi-Fi Prototypes and Heuristic Evaluation](p3.md) - Implement important features of your interface and system, and conduct a heuristic evaluation on its major features. | 12% | 6/23 noon (website); week of 6/19 (demos) |
| [P4: Final Report and Presentation](p4.md) - Provide a report on your work, and present the work to your classmates. | 5% | 6/28 noon (website); week of 6/26 (presentations) |
